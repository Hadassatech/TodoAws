## Description

This is a full-stack todo app.

- There is user authentication, creation of new accounts with email verification, password recovery and form data validation;
- The user can create tasks (_todo_ 's) with title and description, and upload an image for each _todo_;
- All tasks are stored into the app's database (not in the local storage).

## Architecture

The frontend was developed with React and deployed with _[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)_

User authentication was carried out with AWS Amplify libraries and _[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)_.

For the backend it was created a _[GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/)_ with _[AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/appsync/)_ and _[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/)_ services, using a NoSQL database (_[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/dynamodb/)_).
